## Introduction
GameHub is a comprehensive video streaming platform designed exclusively for gamers, bringing together a vibrant community of streamers and viewers. With a focus on interactivity, real-time engagement, and a user-friendly experience, GameHub aims to redefine the gaming streaming landscape.

## Target Problem To Be Solved
Traditional streaming platforms may lack specific features tailored to the gaming community's needs. GameHub addresses this gap by providing a platform that seamlessly integrates gaming-related functionalities, fostering a more immersive and engaging experience for both streamers and viewers.

## Similar Existing Solutions
While [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), and [Facebook Gaming](https://www.facebook.com/gaming/) dominate the video streaming space, GameHub distinguishes itself by offering a specialized set of features tailored to gamers. It combines the best elements of existing platforms while introducing innovative solutions specifically designed for the gaming community.

## Methodology to be Adopted to Solve the Problem
GameHub employs the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack to ensure a robust and scalable solution. The platform leverages real-time communication through sockets for features like live chat, live viewer count, and stream status updates. The use of Next.js ensures efficient server-side rendering (SSR) for a blazing-fast application, contributing to a seamless user experience.
