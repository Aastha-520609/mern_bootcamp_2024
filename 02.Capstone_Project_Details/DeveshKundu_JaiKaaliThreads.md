# Project Details

- Project Name : JaiKaaliThreads
- Problem Statement:
  In the ever-evolving retail landscape, JaiKaaliThreads aims to bridge the gap between traditional local cloth businesses 
  and the growing trend of online shopping. The project seeks to revitalize and expand local cloth businesses by providing 
  them with a robust online presence. It addresses the challenge of adapting to changing consumer preferences post-pandemic, 
  where online platforms dominate, and local businesses often struggle to keep up.
  
  By bringing Jai Kaali Cloth Stores online, the project seeks to enhance visibility, attract a wider customer base, and provide
  a seamless shopping experience, ultimately boosting the business's growth.
